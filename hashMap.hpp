/* NOTE HERE: the map is a dynamically allocated array of nodes.  Meaning it’s a pointer to an array of
/* pointers to nodes.  In this case it is not a matrix.  It is just a pointer to an array, and the array happens
/* to be of pointers (aka addresses).
/*
/* I did this so that I could move the addresses around without having to recreate
/* nodes each time I rehashed.  It looks complicated, but it’s not.  We’ve seen this.
/*
/* To make the map, you’ll do something to the effect of:
/*
map = new hashNode*[mapSize];
/* and then you can either set map[i] = NULL or map[i] = new hashNode(k,v);
/*
/* Make sure you originally set every address in the map array to NULL when you first create the array
/* on the heap.  Make sure you re-set the array to NULL when you rehash.
